scrambler-test
==============

Text scrambler/unscrambler, using jQuery

The first line of this, commented out, simply dumps the original text without any "dressing".

The rest of the javascript is the actual test: create a scramble/descramble widget.

The scramble part simply creates a great deal of random noise around the actual data, while the unscramble side removes all of that random noise.
